New Media Interactive Development &amp; New Media Design Capstone 2025-2026

## Pitch
Step into the tiny shoes of a shrimp, tasked with cleaning the enormous teeth of a monstrous lake creature. Wield a giant toothbrush and floss pick to clean the most plaque off before time runs out!

## Overview

### Projection Mapping
We will utilize projection mapping on the teeth and the user’s immediate environment. There will be a projection across three surfaces in an arched configuration, creating an immersive environment. There would also be a projection beneath the user’s feet on the ground, representing the bottom of the creature’s mouth. The projection would include the monster’s teeth along the upper and lower edges and a view inside the mouth. Physical teeth will be 3D-printed and placed along the bottom and top edges of the screen in line with the projection.

### Tools 
Large object controllers would be built to control the digital interactions, namely a giant toothbrush and floss pick. In our most recent iteration, each tooth will include a photoresistor that picks up light emitted from LEDs in each tool. When they are in close proximity, the photoresistor detects the light, allowing the user to brush or floss the teeth.

### Gameplay
The projection will display a digital representation of the teeth. Animations will indicate if a tooth needs to be cleaned or is actively being cleaned. When the user is not actively cleaning, bacteria would regenerate or multiply, and plaque on the teeth would slowly spread to neighboring teeth. A user must balance the different methods of cleaning to achieve a clean mouth within the time limit.

Upon reaching the time limit, a user would receive a score based on the cleanliness of the mouth. If a player were to fully clean the teeth before time runs out, they would receive bonus points based on the remaining time. Total time, score, and cumulative data across all players, and a leaderboard would be displayed on the result screen.
